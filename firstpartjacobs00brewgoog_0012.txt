PREFAOE.

Tan Latin Reader, a new edition of which is here pre-
sented to the public, was originally prepared by its present
editor, es the first of a series of elementary works adopted
to the Grammar of Andrews and Stoddard. This series
now comprises, in addition to the Grammar above men·
tioned, Questions on the Grammar, Latin Lessons, The
Latin Reader, -Latin Exeroises, A Key to Latin Exereises,
Viri Rome, Cesar’s Commentarios on the Gallie War,
Sallust, and Selections from Ovid. In the present edition,
the adaptation of this work to the Grammar, and to its
place in the series above enumerated,remains unaltered;
hut, in addition to its original design, the Reader is now
intended to constitute the second part of aless extended
series, comprising the editor’s First Latin Book, the Latin
Reader, and the Viri Rome. The latter series is designed
· especially for those who commence the study of Latin at a
very early age, and also for such as intend to pursue the
same study to a limited extent only, or merely as a part of -
general education.

The references at the foot of the pagos relate to the
sections and subordinate divisionsof Andrews and Stod-
dard’s Latin Grammar. The references to Andrews' First
Latin Book may be {lind at the close of the volume. The
marks of reference in the text refer both to the notes at the
foot of the page and to those at the eud of the book. In
the latter series, indeed, other notes are occasionally added,
ond their place is denoted by quoting the words of the text
to which such notes relate.
