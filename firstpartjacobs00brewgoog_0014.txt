found m elementary works are in a great degree lost, in
consequence of their connection with the grammar not
being sufficiently evident. This evil cannot, indeed, be
· avoided, while the grammar with which the student is
lirrnished does not fully explain the idioma of the language.
While referring to the Grammar, the editor has endeavored
to keep in view the fundamental principle of education, that
the only efficient help which the student can receive, is that
which leads him ultimately to exercise his ovvu faculties.
While, therefore, the less prominent difficulties are usually
explained upon their lirst occurrence, the studentis after·
warde, in most cases, left to perceive the additional instances
iu which the same principle is to be applied. In cases of
greater difficulty, however, reference is repeatedly made to
the same principle3 and this is more particularly the case iu
regard to idioma which are either imperfectly exhibited, or
altogether overlooked, in the grammars heretofore in oom-
mou use. It is not improbable that, to some tenchers, the
references may appear too numerous, while, to others, the
unexplained difficulties may still seem too formidable fora
majority of those for whose use the work is intended. No
plan of assistance can be equally well adopted to all students3

but the hope is entertained, that a system which sends them
back to their Grammar for information, will be liable to as

few objections and abuses as any which can be deiised.
'l'he preparation of the vocabulary has occasioned more
labor than any other part of the Reader ;, and, in its present
form, 1 trust that it will be found better adapted to its pur·
pose than auch vocabularies usually are. The meanings
assigned to the words have been selected with careful
reference to all the places where those words occur in the
Reader. In this part, more than in any other, the former
editions of this work were defective, and that in a degree
that would scarcely be suspected by one who had not er·

nmined them in reference to thir subject.
